### 🔄 Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/foodie-app.git
   cd foodie-app
Configure application.properties
For each service, update:

DB URL, username, and password

API keys (Stripe, Google Places)

JWT secret and expiration

Start MySQL and MongoDB

Run all services one by one

bash

cd user-service
mvn spring-boot:run
Repeat for all other services.

Test APIs with Postman
Use the provided Postman collection to test user login, restaurant search, favorites, cart, and payments.

🔐 Authentication
Uses Spring Security and JWT

After login, users get a JWT token to access protected endpoints

🧪 Testing
Use Postman to test each service

Validate authentication, adding to favorites, order/cart logic, and payment flow
